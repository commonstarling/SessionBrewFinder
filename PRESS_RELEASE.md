  Session Brew Finder

  An app for people who want to drink without getting drunk

  Session Brew Finder allows users to find session beers -- brews with less than 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) -- based on their taste for certain types of beers. Users can also keep track of session beers that they might like to try.

  Many craft beers include high ABVs, which can make it hard to enjoy those beers without becoming drunk in a short amount of time. For beer drinkers who want to try different ales without getting drunk, session beers can be a great choice. However, there is no one location with info on various session beers on the market, leaving session brew fans to search numerous sites on the internet for session beer descriptions or just pick a beer with a low ABV without knowing much about the beer's flavor notes or the breweries that made them.

  Session Brew Finder allows you to choose types of session beers that you'd like to try, such as lagers or IPAs, and returns a list of beers that you might consider trying, along with the beer's description. You can save any beers you'd like to keep track of for future enjoyment, or delete ones that you've already checked off the list.

  "I created Session Brew Finder because I found it difficult to find beers that I would be able enjoy without getting tipsy when I went out with friends, which is important when you have a busy lifestyle and need to accomplish other things in your day after an outing," said creator Sheena Ramirez. "Rather than feeling like I can't have a drink, I can now use the app to find a beer that tastes good while allowing me to still feel alert."

  To use Session Brew Finder, just use the drop-down menu to select a type of beer that you'd like to try. A list of beers in that category will show, and you can choose beers that you'd like to save from that list. Use the list on the right side of your screen to review beers that you've already saved or to remove beers from the saved list.

  "Session Brew Finder has allowed me to find craft beers that I didn't even know existed, and I've enjoyed trying the beers on my list," user Tracy Walker says.
